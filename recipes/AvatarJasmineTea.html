<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Achieving balance in this tea is what makes it really shine. By bringing together different expressions of jasmine - 
        as fragrant flowers, also naturally infused into rolled green tea leaves - this tea maintains its gentle nature while
        being strong enough to stand alone and stand out. After all, there is a reason Uncle Iroh named his shop after it!
        It is a remindender of the very nature of life: Where there is balance, there is peace.
