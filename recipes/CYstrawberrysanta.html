<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g fresh Korean strawberries</li>
        <li>500g mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>100g jamón Serrano</li>
        <li>Black pepper, crushed</li>
        <li>honey</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Wash the strawberries and pat dry. Cut the green leafy top off.</li>
        <li>Slice the strawberries in half, horizontally, about 1/3 from the bottom (the pointiest part of the strawberry).
            Separate the top portions and the bottom halves in 2 different plates.</li>
        <li>Line the top halves facing up to prepare for filling. Scoop about a teaspoon chunk of mascarpone cheese
            and place on the top half of the strawberry.</li>
        <li>Rip the jamon into small pieces, fold, and place on top of the mascarpone cheese.</li>
        <li>Place another layer of mascarpone cheese on top of the jamon. </li>
        <li>Now, it's time to complete the strawberry hat by placing the bottom tips on top of the second mascarpone cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Prepare the strawberry hats for final plating. Drizzle honey across the lined up strawberry hats and top off with crushed black pepper.</li>
     </ol>
