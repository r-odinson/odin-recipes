# odin-recipes
It's time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time I've finished, but I'm kind of leaning into some cool brutalist web design, so we'll see.

It's important I keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
